# Disappointed Fans
This is where you come to revel in the glorious defeat of your rivals. The place where you can feast on the tears of your least favorite sports teams. We created ESDN to give people a place to secretly enjoy the defeat of any team based on the selections you make within our filters. Our MVP allows you to search key terms, will reject a few "positive" terms and see a graph based on the last 7 days of twitter data that we've "scraped".

## Built With
- Django - The web framework used
- D3js.org - Charting Library
- jQuery - of course for simplicity
- Twitter API - Source of Data and Frustration
- SASS & Bootstrap - Responsive
- Github - Version control (Obviously)
- Trello - Project Management Tool


## Versioning
We use Git for versioning. Mostly likely, there will be only one major release due to timing.

## Creators
- Sun Davey - Design and Front End
- Chanthy Ngin - Twitter Feed and D3 Integration
- Justin Peterson - Responsive, Validation and Testing


## Acknowledgments
Hat tip to the following libraries for making this possible:
- Twitter for teasing us with just a little data and wanting to make us pay for the rest.
- Tweepy (Python Lib) for getting us started with Twitter
- Python-Twitter-Lib for giving us an "amazing" 100 tweets per request
- D3js.org for the most underutilized library of our project
- SASS and Bootstrap for making responsive easy and tricky at the same time.
- Trello for being free and useful.


## Inspiration
This idea was concieved when thinking about sports bloopers videos and how everyone enjoys watching them. We took a slightly darker turn on this concept to give people a place to either commiserate with other upset fans or for you to enjoy a chuckle provided by your rivals  rage. Future releases may included users to be able to re-tweet, compare different teams against eachother and see  searches from other users. Also a live stream to watch incoming trends related to our theme would be a future release. We hope you enjoy the spirit of the app and use responsible methods to feed your darker tendencies.
